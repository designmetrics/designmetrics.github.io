This is resource for metrics-driven design sparked by the Balanced Team movement.  At Balanced Team SF 2013, a group of makers came together to share methods and challenges around metrics and design.  We're looking to build on that conversation.  Join us in fostering design and products that matter.

<strong>About Balanced Team</strong>
Balanced Team is a group of people who are interested in furthering processes and methodologies to create great things. We welcome people who wear many hats (design, development, testing, product management, marketing and sales) and we value multi-disciplinary collaboration and iterative delivery focused on customer value as a source for innovation.
